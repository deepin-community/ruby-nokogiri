The ruby-nokogiri package uses the Github repository to fetch the test
suite. Upstream does not want to provide a gemspec file in the
repository for reasons explained in Y_U_NO_GEMSPEC.md. As it is crucial
for integration between rubygems and Debian package management system,
we decide to retrieve the gemspec file from the corresponding .gem as
follows:
- import the new tarball and open a changelog entry for this new version
  (This can be done with the "new-upstream" script from the meta repo
- run ./debian/rules gemspec this creates a debian/gemspec file which
  can be committed in the repo.

It seems that the project has been shipping a gemspec since the 1.13.x series.
So the incantation above is obsolete.
